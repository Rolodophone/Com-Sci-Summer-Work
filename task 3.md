## Travel and tourism
This technology has various benefits for travel and tourism. For instance, when visiting an interesting place, you could use your phone to identify monuments or places of attraction that you do not know. However, one limitation is that it could mean that people spend too much time reading about the attraction that actually looking at it in real life. Finally, a risk is that users of the software could injure themselves due to lack of attention to their immediate environment.

## Gaming and Entertainment
On benefit on real-time image detection for gaming and entertainment is that it opens up the possiblity of games that require interaction with real life objects in augmented reality. Although one problem with this idea is the fact that the current state of image detection isn't powerful enough to deliver a consistent experience to all players. Finally, using a camera to detect objects in the user's house brings up privacy concerns as users would need to be assured that the video input does not get sent to the company.

## Education and Learning
Fast image recognition could be also applied to education. One example is that it could be used to aid visually impaired students. For instance, the algorithm could be extended to increase the contrast or otherwise enhance certain objects in a physics demonstration. One limitation with this is that it would require all demonstations be recorded and it would most likely be easier to just explain what is going on. One risk is that recording students in a demonstration would require the consent of their parents and could be argued to be unnecessary.

## Transport and Navigation
The image detection algorithm could of course be used in self-driving cars to allow them to "see" to some extent, so that they can avoid obstacles and people and stay in the lane. One limitation to this is the fact that even though image detection is now very fast, in the TED talk it was described to have a 200 millisecond delay, which may still not be fast enough for fast moving vehicles on a motorway. In addition, as seen in the video, the algorithm is certainly not yet perfect, so there is still a possiblility of accidents.

## Medicine and Healthcare
One benefit that fast image detection could bring to healthcare is that it could be used to help the visually impared. For instance, they could wear special glasses which highlight objects of significance. One limitation of this is that this would of course require wearing a piece of technology at all times, which some people may not be confortable doing. Finally, as with all physical hardware, the risk to our environment caused by manufacturing and eWaste increases.
