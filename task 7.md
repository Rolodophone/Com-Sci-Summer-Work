Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a program to make descisions in a complex, intelligent way. This could be anything from a computer deciding where to move a chess piece, to a robot learning how to walk. Both of these examples are known as weak, or narrow AI as they are only good at a specific task. In contrast, in the quotation  Elon Musk discusses strong AI, or artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is a hypothetical agent capable of learning to perform any task that a human could do. If the intelligence of an AGI surpased that of humans, Musk argues, it would pose an enourmous threat and could destroy the human race, and this does not necessarily require it to be "evil". Several different organisations (e.g. DeepMind, OpenAI) are already tackling the issue of how we can ensure that an AGI is not harmful to society.

Personally, I agree with Musk's statement. It is easy to imagine a variety of ways that an AGI with intelligence greater than that of humans (known as superintelligence) could end up destroying our world. For example, philosopher Nick Bostrom devised a thought experiment in which humans program a superintelligent AGI to produce as many paperclips as it can. While it seems harmless at first, the superintelligence could run out of wire and hijack human technology to produce more. It could turn the entire planet into a paperclip factory, annihilating humanity without second thought.

When talking about an AI destroying humanity, it is easy to fall into the trap of assuming that it would do it out of malice. It is very difficult to imagine what an extremely intelligent machine could be like, and people often impose emotions upon it. However, it is likely that an AGI wouldn't have emotions at all.

On superintelligence, some people may argue that there is no point in discussing it because it will never happen, or it will happen incredibly far into the future so there's no cause for concern. After all, currently, even the best AI sometimes can't tell the difference between a cat and a dog. However, I would argue that problems such as visual identification are actually very difficult. In humans, a substantial portion of our brain is devoted to just seeing, and while it may seem trivial to us, our brain is actually doing huge calculations behind the scenes. Therefore, once AI masters tasks that are easy for humans, such as these, tasks that seem very difficult or even impossible may not be too far away.

I believe that superintelligence is a real, big threat to humanity, on the same level or above nuclear warfare and climate change. It is hard to envision a threat greater than an enourmously intelligent, exponentially learning agent with goals that contradict ours. I believe it is crucial that research into AI safety continues and more people are educated on this issue.
