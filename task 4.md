## Concrete
1. Compare the two Rs and find that they're the same letter
2. Compare the two As and find that they're the same letter
3. Compare the two Cs and find that they're the same letter
4. There's only one letter left in the middle so 'racecar' is a palindrome

## Abstracted
Look at the first and last letter and if they're not equal the word isn't a palindrome; if they're equal keep 
going. Repeat this for each pair of letters going inwards. If you get through all the letters or there's only 
one letter left the word is a palindrome.
